description: Detects the creation of a file with the ".dmp"/".hdmp" extension by a
  shell or scripting application such as "cmd", "powershell", etc. Often created by
  software during a crash. Memory dumps can sometimes contain sensitive information
  such as credentials. It's best to determine the source of the crash.
falsepositives:
- Some administrative PowerShell or VB scripts might have the ability to collect dumps
  and move them to other folders which might trigger a false positive.
