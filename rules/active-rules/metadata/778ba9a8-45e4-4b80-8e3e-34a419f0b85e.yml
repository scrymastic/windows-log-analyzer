description: Detects DNS queries to a TeamViewer domain only resolved by a TeamViewer
  client by an image that isn't named TeamViewer (sometimes used by threat actors
  for obfuscation)
falsepositives:
- Unknown binary names of TeamViewer
- Depending on the environment the rule might require some initial tuning before usage
  to avoid FP with third party applications
