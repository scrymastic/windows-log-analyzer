  as well as the secure attention sequence (SAS) triggered by Ctrl-Alt-Delete.

  Registry entries in HKLM\Software[Wow6432Node]Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\
  and HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\ are

  used to manage additional helper programs and functionalities that support Winlogon.
  Malicious modifications to these Registry keys may cause Winlogon to

  load and execute malicious DLLs and/or executables.
