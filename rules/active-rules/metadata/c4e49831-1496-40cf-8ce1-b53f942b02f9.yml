description: Detects execution of renamed version of PAExec. Often used by attackers
falsepositives:
- Weird admins that rename their tools
- Software companies that bundle PAExec with their software and rename it, so that
  it is less embarrassing
- When executed with the "-s" flag. PAExec will copy itself to the "C:\Windows\" directory
  with a different name. Usually like this "PAExec-[XXXXX]-[ComputerName]"
