description: 'Detects when a program changes the default file association of any extension
  to an executable.

  When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also called the
  file association or handler) is checked. File association selections are stored
  in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs
  that have Registry access or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility.
  Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call
  an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.
