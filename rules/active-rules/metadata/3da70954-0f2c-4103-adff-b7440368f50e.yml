description: 'Detects the creation of the PROCEXP152.sys file in the application-data
  local temporary folder.

  This driver is used by Sysinternals Process Explorer but also by KDU (https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU)
  or Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs), which uses KDU.

  '
falsepositives:
- Other legimate tools using this driver and filename (like Sysinternals). Note -
  Clever attackers may easily bypass this detection by just renaming the driver filename.
  Therefore just Medium-level and don't rely on it.
