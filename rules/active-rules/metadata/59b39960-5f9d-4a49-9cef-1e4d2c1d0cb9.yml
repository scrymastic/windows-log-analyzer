description: Detects usage of the "wusa.exe" (Windows Update Standalone Installer)
  utility to extract cab using the "/extract" argument which is not longer supported.
  This could indicate an attacker using an old technique
falsepositives:
- The "extract" flag still works on older 'wusa.exe' versions, which could be a legitimate
  use (monitor the path of the cab being extracted)
