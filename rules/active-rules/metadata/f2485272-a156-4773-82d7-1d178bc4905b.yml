description: 'Detects installation of NalDrv or PROCEXP152 services via registry-keys
  to non-system32 folders.

  Both services are used in the tool Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs),
  which uses KDU (https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU)

  '
falsepositives:
- Other legimate tools using this service names and drivers. Note - clever attackers
  may easily bypass this detection by just renaming the services. Therefore just Medium-level
  and don't rely on it.
