description: 'Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the
  Registry entries used by services.

  Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for registry to redirect from the originally
  specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code
  at Service start.

  Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
