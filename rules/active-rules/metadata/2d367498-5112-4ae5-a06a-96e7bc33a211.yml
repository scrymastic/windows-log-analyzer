description: 'Detects AnyDesk writing binary files to disk other than "gcapi.dll".

  According to RedCanary research it is highly abnormal for AnyDesk to write executable
  files to disk besides gcapi.dll,

  which is a legitimate DLL that is part of the Google Chrome web browser used to
  interact with the Google Cloud API. (See reference section for more details)
