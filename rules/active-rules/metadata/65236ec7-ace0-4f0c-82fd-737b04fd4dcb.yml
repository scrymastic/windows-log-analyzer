description: 'Detects the creation of new files with the ".evtx" extension in non-common
  or non-standard location.

  This could indicate tampering with default EVTX locations in order to evade security
  controls or simply exfiltration of event log to search for sensitive information
  within.

  Note that backup software and legitimate administrator might perform similar actions
  during troubleshooting.

falsepositives:
- Administrator or backup activity
- An unknown bug seems to trigger the Windows "svchost" process to drop EVTX files
  in the "C:\Windows\Temp" directory in the form "<log_name">_<uuid>.evtx". See https://superuser.com/questions/1371229/low-disk-space-after-filling-up-c-windows-temp-with-evtx-and-txt-files
