description: 'Detects calls to "get-process" where the output is piped to a "where-object"
  filter to search for security solution processes.

  Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive
  tools, and sensors that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment. This
  may include things such as firewall rules and anti-virus

falsepositives:
- False positives might occur due to the nature of the ScriptBlock being ingested
  as a big blob. Initial tuning is required.
- As the "selection_cmdlet" is common in scripts the matching engine might slow down
  the search. Change into regex or a more accurate string to avoid heavy resource
  consumption if experienced
