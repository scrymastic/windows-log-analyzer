description: 'Detects suspicious uses of the SysInternals Procdump utility by using
  a special command line parameter in combination with the lsass.exe process.

  This way we are also able to catch cases in which the attacker has renamed the procdump
  executable.

  '
falsepositives:
- Unlikely, because no one should dump an lsass process memory
- Another tool that uses command line flags similar to ProcDump
