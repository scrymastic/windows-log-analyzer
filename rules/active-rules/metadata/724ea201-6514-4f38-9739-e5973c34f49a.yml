description: 'Detects the setting of the environement variable "windir" to a non default
  value.

  Attackers often abuse this variable in order to trigger a UAC bypass via the "SilentCleanup"
  task.

  The SilentCleanup task located in %windir%\system32\cleanmgr.exe is an auto-elevated
  task that can be abused to elevate any file with administrator privileges without
  prompting UAC.
