description: 'Detects the execution of a renamed AutoIt2.exe or AutoIt3.exe.

  AutoIt is a scripting language and automation tool for Windows systems. While primarily
  used for legitimate automation tasks, it can be misused in cyber attacks.

  Attackers can leverage AutoIt to create and distribute malware, including keyloggers,
  spyware, and botnets. A renamed AutoIt executable is particularly suspicious.
