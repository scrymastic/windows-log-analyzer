description: 'Detects usage of Windows Input Method Editor (IME) keyboard layout feature,
  which allows an attacker to load a DLL into the process after sending the WM_INPUTLANGCHANGEREQUEST
  message.

  Before doing this, the client needs to register the DLL in a special registry key
  that is assumed to implement this keyboard layout. This registry key should store
  a value named "Ime File" with a DLL path.

  IMEs are essential for languages that have more characters than can be represented
  on a standard keyboard, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
