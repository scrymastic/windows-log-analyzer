description: 'This rule detects execution of a PowerShell code through the sqltoolsps.exe
  utility, which is included in the standard set of utilities supplied with the Microsoft
  SQL Server Management studio.

  Script blocks are not logged in this case, so this utility helps to bypass protection
  mechanisms based on the analysis of these logs.

  '
falsepositives:
- Direct PS command execution through SQLToolsPS.exe is uncommon, childprocess sqltoolsps.exe
  spawned by smss.exe is a legitimate action.
