  definition: The "Audit Directory Service Changes" logging policy must be configured
    in order to receive events. Audit events are generated only for objects with configured
    system access control lists (SACLs). Audit events are generated only for objects
    with configured system access control lists (SACLs) and only when accessed in
    a manner that matches their SACL settings. This policy covers the following events
    ids - 5136, 5137, 5138, 5139, 5141. Note that the default policy does not cover
    User objects. For that a custom AuditRule need to be setup (See https://github.com/OTRF/Set-AuditRule)
