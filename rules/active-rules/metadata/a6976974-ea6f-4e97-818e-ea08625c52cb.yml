description: 'Detects a phishing attack which expands a ZIP file containing a malicious
  shortcut.

  If the victim expands the ZIP file via the explorer process, then the explorer process
  expands the malicious ZIP file and drops a malicious shortcut redirected to a backdoor
  into the Startup folder.

  Additionally, the file name of the malicious shortcut in Startup folder contains
  {0AFACED1-E828-11D1-9187-B532F1E9575D} meaning the folder shortcut operation.
