description: 'Detects potential persistence behavior using the windows telemetry registry
  key.

  Windows telemetry makes use of the binary CompatTelRunner.exe to run a variety of
  commands and perform the actual telemetry collections.

  This binary was created to be easily extensible, and to that end, it relies on the
  registry to instruct on which commands to run.

  The problem is, it will run any arbitrary command without restriction of location
  or type.
