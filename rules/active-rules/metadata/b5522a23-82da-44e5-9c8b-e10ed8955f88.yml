description: 'Adversaries may abuse the Windows command shell for execution.

  The Windows command shell ([cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106)) is the
  primary command prompt on Windows systems.

  The Windows command prompt can be used to control almost any aspect of a system,
  with various permission levels required for different subsets of commands.

  Batch files (ex: .bat or .cmd) also provide the shell with a list of sequential
  commands to run, as well as normal scripting operations such as conditionals and
  loops.

  Common uses of batch files include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run
  the same set of commands on multiple system
