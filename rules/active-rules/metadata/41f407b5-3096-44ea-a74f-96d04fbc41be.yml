description: 'Detects the execution of an AnyDesk binary with a version prior to 8.0.8.

  Prior to version 8.0.8, the Anydesk application used a signing certificate that
  got compromised by threat actors.

  Use this rule to detect instances of older versions of Anydesk using the compromised
  certificate

  This is recommended in order to avoid attackers leveraging the certificate and signing
  their binaries to bypass detections.
