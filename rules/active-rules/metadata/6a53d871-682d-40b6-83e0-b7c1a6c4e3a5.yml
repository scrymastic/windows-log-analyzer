description: 'Detect suspicious Kerberos TGT requests.

  Once an attacer obtains a computer certificate by abusing Active Directory Certificate
  Services in combination with PetitPotam, the next step would be to leverage the
  certificate for malicious purposes.

  One way of doing this is to request a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket using a tool
  like Rubeus.

  This request will generate a 4768 event with some unusual fields depending on the
  environment.

  This analytic will require tuning, we recommend filtering Account_Name to the Domain
  Controller computer accounts.

  '
falsepositives:
- False positives are possible if the environment is using certificates for authentication.
  We recommend filtering Account_Name to the Domain Controller computer accounts.
