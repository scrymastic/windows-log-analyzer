  definition: 'Requirements: The "Audit Directory Service Changes" logging policy
    must be configured in order to receive events. Audit events are generated only
    for objects with configured system access control lists (SACLs). Audit events
    are generated only for objects with configured system access control lists (SACLs)
    and only when accessed in a manner that matches their SACL settings. This policy
    covers the following events ids - 5136, 5137, 5138, 5139, 5141. Note that the
    default policy does not cover User objects. For that a custom AuditRule need to
    be setup (See https://github.com/OTRF/Set-AuditRule)'
